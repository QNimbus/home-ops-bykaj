# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated, legacy, or backup resources and configurations that are no longer actively used in the main [home-ops deployment](https://github.com/bykaj/home-ops/tree/main/kubernetes). Items placed here are preserved for historical reference, migration, or potential reuse, but are not part of the current operational stack.

## Usage
- Store old manifests, scripts, or documentation that have been replaced or are no longer needed.
- Use as a backup location before removing resources from the main configuration.
- Reference previous configurations for troubleshooting or rollback purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> Resources in this archive are not applied or managed by automation tools and should not be considered part of the active infrastructure.
